    <h1>Welcome to the EEXCESS-Wiki-Recommender!</h1>

    <p>This extension offers an easy and useful way to enrich your articles with the necessary image or biographical
        sources - all
        searched for and inserted by the click of a button.
    </p>

    <h2>Activate the Extension</h2>

    <p>
        After installation, the extension is activated per default. You can de- or re-activate it by clicking on the
        menu
        bar item <img
            src="../media/icons/19.png" alt="EEXCESS icon"/>.
        Alternatively, you can trigger the extension using the shortcut "Alt+Shift+W" for all major operating
        systems. If the shortcut doesn't work for you, you can change it using the shortcut configuration offered
        in your extensions overview.

    <h2>Search Query Submitting</h2>

    <p>You can submit a search query into the sidebar using the following methods:

    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
            <h3>Search-Bar</h3>
            Type a search query into the search-bar at the top of the sidebar manually and press the submit-button.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Enter</h3>
            Simply hit enter during writing/editing your article. Keywords are extracted out of the context of the
            current paragraph and are searched for automatically.
            The generated query is also inserted into the search-bar to enable you to adapt it further.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Selection</h3>
            Select text with the mouse and press the appearing search button <img src="../media/img/search.png"
                                                                                  alt="search button" width="20px"/>
            to get results matching your selection.
            The generated query is also inserted into the search-bar to enable you to adapt it further.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Result Item Usage</h2>

    <p>
        The search results can then be viewed in detail and inserted into the article at the current cursor position.
